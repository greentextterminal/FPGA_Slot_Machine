# FPGA Slot Machine <br>
This repo contains the code for a simple slot machine like game implemented via Verilog on a ZYBO Z7 ZYNQ-7010 development board. <br>
The board that I used for this project has certain peripherals which I leverage for the logic of the game such as: LED's, switches, and buttons. <br>
